This is a gui script for configuring static ip and dns.
The script currently supports the following distribution:
- Debian
- Ubuntu
- Fedora
- Centos 

it was tested on their latest main version (as of April 2018) so there's no guarantee
it's going to work on older versions.

To run this script run:

1. mkdir ~/NetConf_Script ; cd ~/NetConf_Script

2. git clone https://github.com/BigRush/automation.git

2. sudo bash NetConf.sh
